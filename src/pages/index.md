      Passionate about both programming and education, I consider myself a dual
      practitioner, bringing together proven industry experience as a software
      engineer upon a concrete academic foundation, multiple years of classroom
      teaching experience, and a wealth of pastoral knowledge acquired from
      years of well-recognised volunteerism within student welfare and support.


      ## By day...


      I'm a full-stack software engineer at [Stickee
      Technology](https://www.stickeetechnology.com), with a serious interest in
      building robust and innovative experiences on the web and beyond.


      **Some of the technologies I love: **Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt, Tailwind, and
      more recently, TypeScript and Inertia.js.


      ## By night...


      Mental health is a cause close to my heart. I volunteer a substantial
      amount of time to the [Nightline Association](https://www.nightline.ac.uk)
      as a Regional Coordinator, with the aim of ensuring all students in Wales
      have someone to talk to without judgment and in complete anonymity.


      What started as a hobby project during the 2020 lockdown, I'm working on a
      multitude of upcoming video games under[ Petrobolos
      Games](https://www.petrobolos.com) with the help of some friends.


      I'm also interested in foreign languages, reading, and doing online
      courses.
