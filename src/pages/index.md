      I write a few times a week various computer science, web development, and
      software engineering topics every week. It's my ambition to help more and
      more people into technology and to help learners make the very most out of
      their learning in whatever route they take. 


      Other topics close to my heart might seldom come up, including mental
      health, and pedagogy - the science behind teaching.
