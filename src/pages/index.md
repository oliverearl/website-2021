    title: About me
    section_id: about
    content: >+
      Passionate about both programming and education, I consider myself a dual
      practitioner, bringing together proven industry experience as a software
      engineer upon a concrete academic foundation, multiple years of classroom
      teaching experience, and a wealth of pastoral knowledge acquired from
      years of well-recognised volunteerism within student welfare and support.


      ## By day...


      I'm a full-stack software engineer at [Stickee
      Technology](https://www.stickeetechnology.com), with a serious interest in
      building robust and innovative experiences on the web and beyond.


      ## By night...


      What started as a hobby project during the 2020 lockdown, I'm working on a
      multitude of upcoming video games under[ Petrobolos
      Games](https://www.petrobolos.com) with the help of other talented
      up-and-coming artists and developers. 


      Mental health is a cause close to my heart. I volunteer a substantial
      amount of time to the [Nightline Association](https://www.nightline.ac.uk)
      as a Regional Coordinator, with the aim of ensuring all students in Wales
      have someone to talk to without judgement and in complete anonymity.


      I sometimes stream programming and computer science tuition over on
      [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cskinesis).
